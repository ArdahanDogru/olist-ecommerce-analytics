      Customer cohort analysis tracking first-order delivery experience and lifetime behavior.
      
      **Data Period:** Jan 2017 - May 2018 cohorts (customers with 3+ months to show repeat behavior)
      
      **Key Findings:**
      - Overall repeat purchase rate: 3.6%
      - On-time first delivery: 3.64% repeat rate
      - Delayed first delivery (>3 days): 2.80% repeat rate
      - **23% reduction in repeat purchases from delivery delays**
      
      **Business Impact:** 
      Even though 95% of deliveries are on-time, the 5% with delays show significantly 
      worse customer retention. First-order experience is critical for building repeat customers.
      
      **Use Cases:**
      - Customer lifetime value analysis
      - Delivery performance impact studies
      - Cohort retention tracking
      - Marketing segmentation (repeat vs one-time buyers)
